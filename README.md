L24 Laboratory network simulation using IMUNES

Git mirror: https://git.ecomaikgolf.com/L24-RC-IMUNES

Preconfigured OVA: https://url.ecomaikgolf.com/L24-RC-IMUNES

## Description
Imunes is a "Integrated Multiprotocol Network Emulator/Simulator" created by the University of Zagreb using FreeBSD.

As "Computer Networks" subject needs to be performed on a specific network (practises) i'm trying to replicate it.

## Installation
### I already have IMUNES
Open `L24.imn` with IMUNES

### I don't have IMUNES
Download a preconfigured IMUNES `.ova` from [here](https://url.ecomaikgolf.com/L24-RC-IMUNES).

## TODO
Default Gateways needs to be configured. The network diagram provided doesn't show GW's so i'm waiting to manually check them.
